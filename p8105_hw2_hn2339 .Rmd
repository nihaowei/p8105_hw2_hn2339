NYC_Subway <- read_csv("data /NYC_Subway.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-division, -exit_only, -staffing, -staff_hours, -free_crossover, -north_south_street, -east_west_street, -corner, -station_location, -entrance_location, -entrance_longitude, -entrance_latitude) %>%
  mutate(entry =recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
## There are totally 20 variables in this data set. Retain line, statation name, station longitude/latitude, route1~11, entrance type, entry, vending and ADA compliance. Step 1 is change the capital letter to lower case. Step 2 is remove all the unwanted columns. Step 3 is change the entry variable (YES or NO) to logical variable (TRUE or FLASE)
